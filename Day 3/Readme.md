# 🚀 Day 3 - Combinational and Sequential Optimizations ⚡🔥

Welcome to **Day 3** of the RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program! 🎉 Today you'll master optimization techniques for both combinational and sequential logic circuits! 💪

## 📚 Overview 🌟

**Combinational circuits** 🔌 are time-independent where outputs depend solely on current inputs - you'll learn advanced logic minimization and gate-level optimizations! **Sequential circuits** ⏰ are time-dependent, clock-driven circuits with state memory - you'll explore timing-driven synthesis, clock gating, and power optimization strategies! 🧠
