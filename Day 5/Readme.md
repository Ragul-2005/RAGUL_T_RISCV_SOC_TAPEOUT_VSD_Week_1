<div align="center"> <h1> ðŸ“˜ Day 5 â€“ Optimization in Synthesis </h1></div>

<div align="justify"> ðŸŒŸ Content Overview  
On **Day 5**, we focus on **optimization techniques** in RTL coding and synthesis.  
You will learn how coding styles such as **if-case constructs, incomplete cases, overlapping cases, and loops** affect synthesized hardware.  
Hands-on labs will reinforce these concepts with practical Verilog/VHDL examples.
