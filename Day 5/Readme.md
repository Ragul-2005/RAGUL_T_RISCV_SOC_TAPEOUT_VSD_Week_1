<div align="center"> <h1> ðŸ“˜ Day 5 â€“ Optimization in Synthesis </h1></div>

<div align="justify"> ðŸŒŸ Content Overview  
On **Day 5**, we focus on **optimization techniques** in RTL coding and synthesis.  
You will learn how coding styles such as **if-case constructs, incomplete cases, overlapping cases, and loops** affect synthesized hardware.  
Hands-on labs will reinforce these concepts with practical Verilog/VHDL examples.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  
By the end of Day 5, you will be able to:  

- âœ¨ Understand how **if-case constructs** affect synthesized hardware.  
- âœ¨ Identify and resolve issues with **incomplete if-case conditions**.  
- âœ¨ Recognize the implications of **incomplete and overlapping case statements**.  
- âœ¨ Apply **for loops** and **for-generate constructs** effectively in RTL coding.  
- âœ¨ Optimize RTL code for better synthesis results in terms of **area, timing, and readability**.
