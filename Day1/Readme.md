  <h1>Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Day 1</strong> of the RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program! Today, you'll learn <strong>Verilog RTL design</strong> and <strong>synthesis</strong> using open-source tools including <strong>Icarus Verilog (iverilog)</strong>, <strong>GTKWave</strong>, and <strong>Yosys</strong>. Through hands-on labs and practical exercises, you'll master simulation workflows, waveform analysis, and logic synthesis with the industry-standard <strong>Sky130 PDK</strong>. Get ready to build a strong foundation in digital design using cutting-edge open-source tools!</p>
