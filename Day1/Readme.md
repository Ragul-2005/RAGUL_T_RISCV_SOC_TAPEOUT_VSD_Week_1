## 1. What is Simulator, Design and Testbench
### Simulator
A **Simulator** is software that runs the <b>design</b> along with the <b>testbench</b>, allowing designers to check and debug the circuitâ€™s functionality before building the actual hardware.

### Design
A **Design** is the HDL code that describes the behavior or structure of a digital circuit. It acts as the blueprint for the hardware.

### Testbench
A **Testbench** is used to apply inputs to the design, monitor outputs, and verify that the circuit works correctly under different conditions.
